This inhibition leads to higher cortisol levels, which feedback inhibits the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, resulting in decreased adrenal output of cortisol and increased DHEA production. Consequently, the increase in DHEA is due to the reduced negative feedback on the HPA axis. This can  thereby increase DHEA-S levels.",
